## Mapping Earthquakes with Leaflet.js, MapBox, and GeoJSON

#### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

#### Tasks

1. Create maps using the MapBox API and customize with Leaflet.js
2. Add background tile layers and data layers
3. Add styling to data layers
4. Add a legend and layer control objects to the map

#### Approach

I  used the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from GeoJSON data. Then I used the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
